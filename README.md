# Inverse-Kinematics
Computer Graphics - Assignment 3


An IK solver implementation using the CCD algorithm.


Usage:
* Space to start / stop the IK solver.
* Mouse click to select a link.
* U/D rotates picked link around the current X axis
* L/R rotates picked link around the previous link Z axis
* If nothing is picked, rotates the whole scene.
* Scroll up / down to translate destination cube or whole chain from or into the screen.
* It is possible to change the amount of links by changing the constant ARRAY_LENGTH.
